        <p class="sectionSubTag smallText"> Education in India is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements, 
            policy reforms, and the evolving demands of the global economy. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has laid the foundation for a 
            more holistic, flexible, and multidisciplinary approach to learning, moving away from rote memorization and emphasizing critical thinking, 
            creativity, and problem-solving skills. The integration of digital tools such as AI, virtual reality, and online platforms has 
            revolutionized learning, making education more accessible, especially for students in remote areas. Initiatives like DIKSHA, SWAYAM, 
            and e-Pathshala have expanded access to quality resources, ensuring that learning is not confined to traditional classrooms. Additionally, 
            there is a growing shift towards skill-based and vocational education, equipping students with practical knowledge and industry-relevant skills. 
            The emphasis on coding, entrepreneurship, and experiential learning at an early stage is preparing students for future careers in a rapidly changing 
            job market.
